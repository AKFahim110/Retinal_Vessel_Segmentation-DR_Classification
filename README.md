# 🔬 Retinal Vessel Segmentation and Diabetic Retinopathy Classification using Vessel Graph-Based U-Net (VGA-Net)

This project presents a comprehensive deep learning pipeline for **retinal vessel segmentation** and **diabetic retinopathy classification** based on a **modified VGA-Net** architecture. It combines **pixel-level feature extraction**, graph-level structure preservation, and **disease classification** using graph-based attention mechanisms. The thesis was completely done using Keggle notebook.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ✅ Dataset Setup

Make sure the DRIVE dataset is placed correctly in:
```
data/DRIVE/
├── training/
└── test/
```


📁 Dataset:

Datasets used in this project are available here: 🔗 https://drive.grand-challenge.org/DRIVE/


### ✅ Run on Google Colab or Kaggle

Clone or upload the notebook and run the cells in order. Please note that Keggle has been employed for this work

```bash
# For segmentation:
Run: main_file.ipynb

# For classification:
Run: main_file.ipynb
```
-- Note: Segmentation and Classification are in the same notebook



### ✅ Sample Execution Flow

1. Import libraries and set dataset path
2. Preprocess fundus images
3. Train VGA-Net for vessel segmentation
4. Extract vessel features and perform classification using segmented output
5. Evaluate and visualize results for both task
